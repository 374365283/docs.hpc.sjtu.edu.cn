# Databases and Web Services

## JGI Services at NERSC

Any long-lived process or process listening to a network socket to communicate
requires some special attention and care to ensure that the service is
accessible to the appropriate audience, is properly monitored, and maintained
correctly. The rules and guidlines presented here are intended to strike a
balance between convenience of running and developing services with the need
for system maintenance, distribution of resources, appropriate security, and
monitoring of each service.

All services, even development services, should be registered with NERSC.
Please [file a help ticket](https://help.nersc.gov/) to begin the registration
process.

## Web (HTTP/HTTPS) Services

Any service transporting data via `HTTP` or other related protocols (`HTTPS`,
`AJP`) needs very careful handling because of the heightened risk of a security
incident. For this reason, we have a special focus on providing
additional assistance with web services.  Each interactive
system will operate a system-level `httpd` binding all common `HTTP` and
`HTTPS` ports. This system-level `httpd` is used to provide proxy and reverse
proxy service to user web services.  It is not intended to directly serve
content. A web service is any service using `HTTP` or related protocol for
transport, or delivering any form of `HTML`, `XHTML`, `JSON` or other formats
understood by generic client software.  Any service used to directly
launch processes on compute systems will require special scrutiny.

### Guidelines for Running Web Services

* All services should endeavor to support `HTTPS` (encrypted `HTTP`) as the
  default method of communication. NERSC will provide appropriate certificates 
  for `nersc.gov` addresses on the system-level proxying `httpd`.
* All services must log all connections and requests to the central logging
  facility using a common format; using the proxying `httpd` satisfies this
  requirement.
* All production services must be centrally monitored via a NERSC-provided
  nagios instance.  The implementation of this monitoring is determined based on
  the needs and requirements of the service.
* Web services may only bind to ports on the loopback device (`127.0.0.1`), and
  only on ports assigned to the service by NERSC staff. The assigned ports will
  be unique across the entire system to enable multiple services to operate on
  the same host simultaneously.
* Each service will require a fully qualified hostname in the `jgi.doe.gov`
  domain.
* Any service passing authentication credentials must use `HTTPS` to secure the
  communication.
* Any service starting processes must require some kind of authentication or
  pre-shared key to mitigate risk of unauthorized access.
* Only the NERSC-operated proxy `httpd` will provide access to services on ports
  `80`, `443`, `8000`, `8080`, and `8443`.

### Public Web Services

JGI users may host web services for public access. NERSC offers two web hosting
environments, [Spin](https://docs.nersc.gov/services/spin/) and virtual
machines. The requirements of your web service will determine which of these
environments is appropriate. Please [contact NERSC](https://help.nersc.gov/)
with inquiries regarding public web services.

### Getting Started

When youâ€™re ready, [submit a request](https://help.nersc.gov) with the details
of your planned web service. A NERSC consultant or other staff member will
respond to let you know when the hosting environment is ready for you to
deploy the development or test version (including an assigned `TCP` port), or to
seek any additional detail needed.

Production web services must be reviewed before they are launched. In
preparation for this, please give advance consideration to:

* look and feel: is the service and its behavior consistent with other related
  services?
* on-going maintenance: what individual or group will be responsible for 
  maintaining the service in the future?
* application security: does the service follow the secure coding standards
  provided by
  [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_Secure_Coding_Practices_-_Quick_Reference_Guide)
  and [CERT](http://www.cert.org/secure-coding/research/secure-coding-standards.cfm),
  and are any software dependencies bundled with the application (e.g. Perl or
  Python modules, or Ruby GEMs) regularly updated?

## Service Security

Maintaining service security is an ongoing responsibility of the service
operator. The NERSC security team will periodically scan systems and may
provide guidance, however, the service operator is ultimately responsible.
These responsibilities include configuring the service to minimize risk of
exposure, discovering potential security vulnerabilities, and ensuring the
latest security patches are applied to software in use.

### Security Guidelines

* Any service directly launching processes should require some kind of
  authentication or pre-shared key to reduce risk of unauthorized access.
* All communcations should be encrypted, if possible.
* Communications of authentication credentials or pre-shared keys must be
  encrypted.
* Connections should be restricted to computers in the NERSC (`128.55.\*.\*`)
  and possibly LBL (`128.3.\*.\*` or `131.243.\*.\*`) address space.
* Any discovered security issues should be addressed quickly; it may be
  necessary to stop the service or disable associated accounts
  while addressing a security issue.

### Backups

The service operator is responsible for ensuring appropriate backups are made.
This may be as simple as ensuring the primary data store for the service is in an
backed up portion of the filesystem. If the operator chooses to store the service
on a local disk, they are responsible for both backup and restore of that data and
software.
