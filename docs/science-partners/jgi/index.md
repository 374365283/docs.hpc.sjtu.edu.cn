NERSC offers various resources for the
[DOE Joint Genome Institute](https://jgi.doe.gov/).

## [Computational Systems](systems.md)

JGI users have access to the main computational systems at NERSC, Cori and
Edison, as well as the Denovo cluster.

## [Filesystems](filesystems.md)

JGI users also have access to a variety of filesystems at NERSC, some of which
are shared and some of which are exclusive to JGI use.

## [Software](software.md)

NERSC provides some software via the "module" system, and we encourage users to
build and install their own software as needed.

## [Training and Tutorials](training.md)

This is a summary page for the training and tutorial sessions that have been
given at the JGI. Downloads of training materials are available.

## [Databases and Web Services](services.md)
