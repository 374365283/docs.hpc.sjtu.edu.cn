# Abinit

ABINIT is a software suite to calculate the optical, mechanical,
vibrational, and other observable properties of materials. Starting
from the quantum equations of density functional theory, you can build
up to advanced applications with perturbation theories based on DFT,
and many-body Green's functions (GW and DMFT).

NERSC provides modules for [abinit](https://www.abinit.org).

Use the `module avail` command to see what versions are available:

```bash
nersc$ module avail abinit
```
