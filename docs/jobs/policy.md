!!! tip
	Jobs using 1024 or more KNL nodes receive a 50% discount!

!!! note
	User held jobs that were submitted more than 12 weeks ago will be deleted.

### JGI Accounts

There are 192 Haswell nodes reserved for the "genepool" and
"genepool_shared" QOSes combined.  Jobs run with the "genepool" QOS
uses these nodes exclusively. Jobs run with the "genepool_shared" QOS
can share nodes.

| QOS             | Max nodes | Max time (hrs) | Submit limit | Run limit | Priority |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| genepool        | 16        | 72             | 500          | -         | 3        | 
| genepool_shared | 0.5       | 72             | 500          | -         | 3        | 

## Charging

Jobs are charged by the node-hour in every QOS except shared. 

!!! warn
	For users who are members of multiple NERSC repositories
	charges are made to the default account, as set
	in [NIM](https://nim.nersc.gov), unless the `#SBATCH
	--account=<NERSC repository>` flag has been set.

!!! example
	A job which ran for 35 minutes on 3 KNL nodes on Cori with
	the regular QOS would be charged:
	$$ (35/60)\\ \text{hours}*3\\ \text{nodes} * 90 = 157.5\\ \text{NERSC hours} $$

!!! example
	A job which ran for 12 hours on 4 physical cores (each core has 2 hyperthreads)
	on Cori Haswell with the shared QOS would be charged:
	$$ 12\\ \text{hours} * (2*4\\ \text{cores}/64) * 90 = 135\\ \text{NERSC hours} $$

!!! note
    Jobs are charged only for the actual walltime used. That is, if a job uses less
    time than requested, the corresponding account is charged only for the actual job
    duration.

## Intended use

### Debug

The "debug" QOS is to be used for code development, testing, and
debugging. Production runs are not permitted in the debug QOS. User
accounts are subject to suspension if they are determined to be using
the debug QOS for production computing. In particular, job `chaining`
in the debug QOS is not allowed. Chaining is defined as using a batch
script to submit another batch script.

### Interactive
The "interactive" QOS is to be used for code development, testing, and
debugging in an interactive batch session.  Jobs should be submitted
via 'salloc -q interactive' along with other salloc flags (such as 
number of nodes, node feature, and walltime request, etc.).

### Premium

The intent of the "premium" QOS is to allow for faster turnaround before
conferences and urgent project deadlines. It should be used with care. 
NERSC has a target of keeping premium usage at or below 10 percent of all usage.

### Low

The intent of the "low" QOS is to allow non-urgent jobs to run with a 
lower usage charge.

### Flex

The intent of the â€œflex" QOS is for user jobs that can produce useful work with 
a relatively short amount of run time before terminating. For example, jobs that 
are capable of checkpointing and restarting where they left off may be able to 
use the flex QOS. Note that this QOS is available on Cori KNL only.

Benefits to using the flex QOS include: The ability to improve your throughput 
by submitting jobs that can fit into the cracks in the job schedule; A discount 
in charging for your job. 

You can access the flex queue by submitting with `-q flex`. Note this is only 
available on Cori KNL.  In addition, 
you must specify a minimum running time for this job of 2 hours or less with 
the `--time-min` flag. Because the walltime you receive may vary, we recommend
implementing checkpoint/restart capabilities within your code or using DMTCP to 
checkpoint your code. Jobs submitted without the `--time-min` flag will be 
automatically rejected by the batch system. The max 
wall time request limit (requested via `--time` or `-t` flag) for flex jobs 
must be greater than 2 hours and not exceed 48 hours.

!!! example
        A flex job requesting a minimum time of 1.5 hours, and max wall time of
        10 hrs:
	`sbatch -q flex --time-min=01:30:00 --time=10:00:00 my_batch_script.sl`

### Scavenger

The intent of the scavenger QOS is to allow users with a zero or
negative balance in one of their repositories to continue to run jobs.
The scavenger QOS is not available for jobs submitted against
a repository with a positive balance. The charging rate for this QOS
is 0 and it has the lowest priority on all systems.

If you meet the above criteria, you can access the scavenger queue by
submitting with `-q scavenger` (`-q shared_scavenger` for the shared
queue). In addition, you must specify a minimum running time for this
job of 4 hours or less with the `--time-min` flag. We recommend you implement 
checkpointing in your scavenger jobs to save your progress. Jobs submitted 
without these flags will be automatically rejected by the batch system.

!!! example
        A scavenger job requesting a minimum time of 1.5 hours:
	`sbatch -q scavenger --time-min=01:30:00 my_batch_script.sl`

[^1]:
	Jobs in the "shared" QOS are only charged for the fraction of the
	node used.

[^2]:
	The "scavenger" QOS is *only* available when running a job would
    cause the *repository* (not only the user's allowed fraction)
    balance to go negative.  For scavenger jobs a `--time-min` of 
    4hrs or less is required.

[^3]:
	The "realtime" QOS is only available via
    [special request](https://nersc.service-now.com/catalog_home.do?sysparm_view=catalog_default).

[^4]:
	Batch job submission is not enabled and the 64 node
    limit applies **per repository** not per user.

[^5]:
	The "special" QOS is via special permission only.

[^6]:
	The "regular" and "premium" QOS charges on Cori KNL are discounted
    by 50% if the job uses 1024 or more nodes.

[^7]:
	The "low" QOS (available on Cori KNL only) is charged 50% as compared to 
	the "regular" QOS, but no extra large job discount applies.

[^8]:
    The current charging rate for flex is 25% (subject to change) as compared 
    to the "regular" QOS.
