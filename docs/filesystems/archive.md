The High Performance Storage System (HPSS) is a modern, flexible,
performance-oriented mass storage system. It has been used at NERSC
for archival storage since 1998. HPSS is intended for long term
storage of data that is not frequently accessed.

HPSS is Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) software developed by a
collaboration of DOE labs, of which NERSC is a participant, and
IBM. The HSM software enables all user data to be ingested onto high
performance disk arrays and automatically migrated to a very large
enterprise tape subsystem for long-term retention. The disk cache in
HPSS is designed to retain many days worth of new data and the tape
subsystem is designed to provide the most cost-effective long-term
scalable data storage available.

NERSC's HPSS system is named archive.nersc.gov and can be accessed
through a variety of clients such as hsi, htar, ftp, pftp, and grid
clients.
