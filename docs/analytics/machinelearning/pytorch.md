# PyTorch

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a high-productivity Deep Learning framework based on dynamic
computation graphs and automatic differentiation. It is designed to be as close
to native Python as possible for maximum flexibility and expressivity.

## Availability on Cori

PyTorch can be picked up from the Anaconda python installations (e.g. via
`module load python`) or from dedicated modules with MPI enabled. You can
see which version are available with `module avail pytorch-mpi`.

## Multi-node training

PyTorch makes it fairly easy to get up and running with multi-node training
via its included _distributed_ package. Refer to the distributed tutorial for
details: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html

## Examples
