## Modules

Modules is a system which you can use to specify what software you want to use.  If you want to use a particular software package loading its module will take care of the details of modifying your environment as necessary.  The advantage of the modules approach is that the you are not required to explicitly specify paths for different executable versions and try to keep their related man paths and environment variables coordinated.  Instead you simply "load" and "unload" specific modules to control your environment.

### Using modules

	module avail cray-fftw
