## OSTP/Office of Science Data Management Requirements

Project Principal Investigators are responsible for meeting OSTP
(Office of Science and Technology Policy) and DOE Office of Science
data management requirements for long-term data sharing and
preservation. The OSTP has issued a memorandum on Increasing Access to
the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research
(http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf)
and the DOE has issued a Statement on Digital Data Management.

NERSC resources are intended for users with active allocations, and as
described below, NERSC cannot guarantee long-term data access without
a prior, written, service-level agreement.  Please carefully consider
these policies, including their limitations and restrictions, as you
develop your data management plan.
